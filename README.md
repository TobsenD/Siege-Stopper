# Siege Stopper
This is a simple Mod to stop Zombie Sieges from appearing in your Minecraft world.

## Note
This Mod is an 1.20+ update for the Mod Village Siege Disabler [Forge] as it seems to be little to no longer maintained.

I will try to offer this mod also for other Forge versions. A port to Fabric will not exist from my side, because I don't play Fabric. Feel free to use the code though.
